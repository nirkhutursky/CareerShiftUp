## Key Flutter Concepts Used

### 1. **State Management with Provider**
   - The `Provider` package is used to manage global states like work experiences, languages, and user inputs.
   - All data operations (add, remove, validate) are handled through the `resume_provider.dart`.

### 2. **Dynamic UI with `setState`**
   - **Dynamic Panels**: The UI updates dynamically when users add or remove fields (e.g., work experiences or languages).
   - **`setState`** ensures changes to the UI reflect instantly within the stateful widgets.

### 3. **Form Validation**
   - Custom validation methods ensure inputs are correct (e.g., alphabet-only restrictions).
   - Displays specific error messages and restricts submission until all fields are valid.

### 4. **Reusable Widgets**
   - Components like text fields, dropdown menus, and buttons are modular and reusable.
